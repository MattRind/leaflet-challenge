# leaflet-challenge
The assignment had us select the `json` file from the USGS website; I chose one that covered last 7 days of historical earthquake data since it was a good balance of data to display without taking too much time to load. I used `console.log` to debug the code that I wrote. For example I discovered that there were some negative value for both earthquake intensity and depth, and had to write code to handle this. To show earthquake intensity, I used an exponential function since the Richter scale is also expontentally based ( include a reference in the `index.html` file). To show earthquake depth, I created 6 different color categories. Surprisingly the Leaflet documentation has its shortcomings for providing guidance on creating a map legend. Perhaps, it assumes good knowlegde of `html` and `css`. The three files with code in this repo are the `index.html`, `logic.js` and `style.css`, from which the latter two are in their own subfolders in the static folder. All code was written by me.
